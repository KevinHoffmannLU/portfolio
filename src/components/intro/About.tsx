      <p>
        Ever since I was a kid, I always liked the idea of being a coder and
        still remember writing my first simple windows batch script when I was
        8.
      </p>
      <p>Sadly I didn't pursue it until later in life.</p>
      <p>
        After dropping out of high school, I started working in a fast food
        restaurant and about 6 months in I realized that this wasn't the life I
        wanted. So I started teaching myself math and programming to hopefully
        one day make it in a career I enjoyed. I ended up working for my
        employer for about a year, when I decided to go all in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I feel I have grasped most of the fundamentals and am ready to take
        on the next steps.
